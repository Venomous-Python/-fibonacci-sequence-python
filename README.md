# Fibonacci Sequence Python
How to code the Fibonacci sequence.

# What is the Fibonacci Sequence
It is a sequence created by Leonardo Fibonacci. The sequence usually begins at 0 and 1. The sum of the last equation is added to the last number for infinity.

# Code Explanation

a = 0 (Creating the value we want to start at)

print(a) (Displaying the value)

b = 1 (Creating the second value we add to the first)

print(b) (Displaying the second value

for i in range(How many numbers in the sequence you want): (This is a loop that lasts as many times as the number in range(): )

    c = a + b (Variable c is the sum of a + b)
    
    print(c) (Display c)
    
    a = b (We then change the value of a the equal b which is the more recent number)
    
    b = c (We change b to equal c which is the sum)
